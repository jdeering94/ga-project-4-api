## Major Hurdles

An initial struggle was configuring the database to accomodate descriptions for the song's context or usage in a certain film. The solution was to use django's 'through' method on the many to many relationship, and a new model named Context, which allows for information to be stored that is relevant to the join table of song and film.

I also used the tailwind css library for the first time, so it was a challenge to get acquainted with it.
